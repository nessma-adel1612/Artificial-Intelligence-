    <td>Machine Learning is the science of getting machines to interpret, process and analyze data in order to solve real-world problems.</td>
    <td>Deep Learning is the process of implementing Neural Networks on high dimensional data to gain insights and form solutions. Deep Learning is an advanced field of Machine Learning that can be used to solve more advanced problems.</td>
    <td>Natural Language Processing (NLP) refers to the science of drawing insights from natural human language in order to communicate with machines and grow businesses.</td>
    <td>Robotics is a branch of Artificial Intelligence which focuses on different branches and application of robots. AI Robots are artificial agents acting in a real-world environment to produce results by taking accountable actions.</td>
    <td>An expert system is an AI-based computer system that learns and reciprocates the decision-making ability of a human expert.
</td>
    <td> Fuzzy logic is a computing approach based on the principles of “degrees of truth” instead of the usual modern computer logic i.e. boolean in nature.</td>
